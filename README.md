# Go 99
Go version of 99 problems.

Professor Werner Hett created an interesting collection of 99 problems to practice programming. He created the collection with Prolog in mind, but it is adapted to many other languages. More info can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems)

This is an attempt to solve those problems using go programing language.
The solutions provided here is neither the most elegant nor the best performing solutions. 

## List

### 1. Write a function that returns the last element of a list
P01.go contains a solution for this based on slice in go

### 2. Write a function that returns the last but one element of a list.
P02.go contains a solution based on slice in go

### 3. Write a function that returns the K th element of a list.
P03.go contains a solution based on slice in go

### 4. Write a function that counts the number of elements in a list.
P04.go contains a solution based on slice in go

### 5. Write a function that reverse the elements in a list.
P05.go contains a solution based on slice in go
