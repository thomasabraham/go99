# Go 99
Go version of 99 problems.

Professor Werner Hett created an interesting collection of 99 problems to practice programming. He created the collection with Prolog in mind, but it is adapted to many other languages. More info can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems)

This is an attempt to solve those problems using go programing language.
The solutions provided here is neither the most elegant nor the best performing solutions.

4. [Count the number of elements in a list](list/p04.go)
5. [Reverse the elements in a list](list/p05.go)
6. [Check if the given list is palindrome](list/p06.go)
7. [Flatten a nested list structure](list/p07.go)
